	---------------------------------------------
		 You know those little faces made with letters from your keyboard? They're called emoticons and they're taking the world (on-line and off) by storm. So much so that last Saturday, a baby born at the Paul B. Hopskins Hospital recieved one as a name.

	<u>Picture of Birth Certificate</u>		You read that right, the 8oz-ite
	==================================		is legally named <u> O:-) </u>,
	=				 =		another way of saying Angel!
	=				 =		While I was at the park today, I
	=				 =		asked a couple of people what they
	=				 =		thought about this new form of
	=				 =		identification- these are my 
	=				 =		favorite answers:
	=				 =		"Liberal crap."
	=				 =		"America is turning into a third
	==================================		world country at first world speed."

		"Oh? That's real? Wow. I hope this doesn't become a trend. For a lot of reasons."
		"Rad."

If we don't do this now- by the time it's 2020, everyone will have to just have numbers as names. When I call my friend, I'm gonna have to yell "202253636." I'd rather not. I'd rather call him smiling devil face."
